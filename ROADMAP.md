# Wishlist

- mb function parameter names from tmux source?
- mb better struct fields names
- mb folder structure, separate tmux functions from parse functions
- does `Option<bool>` as function arguments and structure fields make sense
- mb store `PathBuf` or other type for paths in parsed structures?
- optional arguments if they are more than 1 wrap in struct?
- [x] all required (non-optional) arguments move out from struct, use them directly
- callbacks or hooks or smtg like in [Jezza's fork](https://github.com/Jezza/tmux-interface-rs/)
- mb FFI as a C lib?
- [x] enum for pane size specification `[-l size | -p percentage]`
- [x] mb enum for things like `[size | percentage]` in options?
- mb default most needed struct fields initialized with `new()`?
- [ ] rename subcommand to command function
- [ ] add custom command function
- mb macro for translate letter keys into structure field names
- mb conditional compiling depending on tmux version (versions based on travis ci ubuntu packages)
- mb split into 3 libs? (recv, send, options)
- support older tmux versions:
    - [x] tmux X.X latest
    - [x] tmux 2.6
    - [ ] tmux 2.1
    - [ ] tmux 1.8
    - [ ] tmux 1.6
    - [ ] commands
    - [ ] options
- mb merge flags? (`-A -B -C` = `-ABC`)
- mb impl builder pattern (how to combine TMUX + AttachSession in right way)
    - [ ] builder pattern
- mb some loops into iterators
- mb split tmux versions in different folders
- mb split into different librarys (options, get, set objects)
- mb all args as sructs because of versions diffs?


# Tiny ADR

Simplified Architecture Decision Record for strategy and decision making.

- tmux versions support (decision, not current state)
    - [ ] all
    - [x] `^0.8` man of the first version found in repo (not full support)
    - [x] `^1.0` structure of commands stabilization? (not full support)
    - [x] `^2.6` make full support
    - [x] `^3.1` make full support

- additional tmux plugin?
    - [x] no, standalone library (current decision)
        reason: trying to follow UNIX-way, KISS
    - [ ] yes, more options and features possible

- tmux subcommands have optional boolean keys, wrapping method?
    - [x] `Option<bool>` (current decision)
        reason: "mapping" of CLI syntax characters ("12.1 Utility Argument Syntax"
        [IEEE Std 1003.1-2017](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap12.html))
        `tmux lsp [-a] [-t target]`
    - [ ] `bool` directly
        reason: it's simple, for all not boolean keys it's still `Option<T>`

- tmux subcommands have many keys?
    - [ ] pass all keys as function arguments
    - [ ] less than 4 keys - as arguments, more - structure
    - [x] optional keys (> 4) as structure, all required keys as function arguments directly
        (current decision)
        reason: simple function call by default if no args needed
    - [ ] all optional keys (> 1) - as structure, all required keys as arguments?
    - [ ] group optional keys in struct by usage (for example: target as direct
        argument)?

- tmux subcommnads have many optional keys in some structure?
    - [x] `Option<&TmuxSubcommandParameters>` (current decision)
        reason: if all structure fields are `None`, structure itself does not
        to be needed
    - [ ] `&TmuxSubcommandParameters`

- multiple tmux versions?
    - [x] conditional compilation depending on version needed, using `feature = tmux_X_X"`
       (current decision)
    - [ ] runtime version detecting and corresponding code execution. Library
        size?

- API calling concept?
    - [x] "Conventional"? (current decision)
        ```
        let tmux = TmuxInterface::new();
        tmux.env = "abc";
        let attach_session = AttachSession {
            ..Default::default()
        };
        tmux.attach_session(&attach_session);
        ```
    - [ ] "Chaining"? Better ergonomics? Allow disallow arguments for commands?
        need to be analyzed, switch looks nice and reasonable
        ```
        TmuxInterfaceBuilder::new().env("abc").attach_session().target().run().bool_result();
        ```
        or smthg like:
        ```
        let tmux = TmuxInterfaceBuilder::new().env().build();
        let cmd = TmuxCommandBuilder::new(&tmux).attach_session().target().run();
        let result = TmuxOutput::new(&cmd).bool_result();
        ```
        ```
        ::new() -> TmuxInterfaceBuilder
        .build() -> TmuxInterface
        .attach_session(self: TmuxInterface) -> AttachSessionBuilder
        .run(self: AttachSessionBuilder) -> TmuxOutput or bool
        .bool_result() -> merge previous
        ```
    - [ ] both
        ```
        TmuxInterfaceBuilder::new() -> TmuxInterfaceBuilder
        .env(self: TmuxInterfaceBuilder, str) -> TmuxInterfaceBuilder
        .attach_session(self: TmuxInterfaceBuilder) -> AttachSessionBuilder
        .cmd(self: AttachSessionBuilder) -> TmuxInterface
        .run(self: TmuxInterface) -> TmuxOutput
        .bool_result(self: TmuxInterface) -> bool
        ```

- `&'a str` vs `T: Display` for request structures?
    - [x] str, nothing to modify, no need for String
    - [ ] String, better usability

- `target_*` `AsRef<>`, `Into<>`?
    - [x]  using raw enum field, ugly
        ```
        .kill_pane(..., TargetPane::Raw("$1:@2.3"))
        .kill_pane(..., TargetPane::Id(3))
        ```
    - [ ] using generic implementations ...
        ```
        .kill_pane(..., "$1:@2.3")`
        .kill_pane(..., TargetPane::Id(3))
        ```

- Architecture

    - [ ] low level abstraction
        ```
        tmux.cmd(NEW_SESSION).flag(A).flag(B).option(C, option).arg(argument).exec()
        ```
        - mb macro, reusable in mid high?

    - [x] mid level abstraction (current)
        ```
        NewSessionBuilder().new().name().build() (.exec()?)
        tmux.new_session(new_session)
        ```

    - [ ] high level abstraction
        ```
        session.new(name, option)
        .get()
        .rename()
        window.new(name, option)
        ```
        - names not the same as in tmux, complete another model, mb better
          suitable for rust app


- Wrap std::process::Command method:
    - call Command::new() for every command
    - single Command::new() and methods call, repeating previous command




- Traits
    - [ ] trait can't access parent struct fields, without extra implementation
      of get set method, `.output()` if we are working with same type problems
      multiple traits methods mixing allowed (NewSession, DetachClient,
      chaining methods)

- Structs
    - [ ] main `Tmux{bin, arg}`, wrapper `TmuxCommand {Tmux, cmd, arg}`, `NewSession(TmuxCommand)`
            chain: `new() -> arg() -> exec()` for parent is broken,
            can't access children args, as parent, `Tmux::output() { Command::new,
            Command.arg(arg???)`}
    - [x] main `TmuxCommand{bin, bin_arg, cmd, cmd_arg}`, wrapper `NewSession(TmuxCommand)` `Tmux(TmuxCOmmand)`

- Main struct
    - [ ] newtype(Command) bc. Command contains args will not be flushed
    - [x] struct containing bin, args, reusing, subclassing, editing possible

- macro for fn generation
    - [ ] yes, source size, unification calls
    - [x] no, doc problem, needs capturing inside macro invocation, no profit
      for method gen `target_name(name);`

 2. String for hooks and mutability
 1. bin and cmd must be in same struct?
      [x] one struct, understanding~+
      [ ] two structs, complexity~+, usability~-
      call wrapping impossible cmd+args(tmux+args) != tmux args cmd args

 - Check tmux order options flags matters?

 - architecture:
      [ ] trait, supertrait
          multiple synonymous child traits, specifying needed:
          `<TmuxCommand as NewSession>::new()` trait annotation need
          no bc.converting from to implementation?
          no bc. all methods available for main type
      [ ] struct wrapper
            common trait, exec(), output()?
      [ ] type alias
            no, bc. all methods available, can not select

 - exec vs run
      [ ] exec
      [ ] run
      [x] output - same as `std::process:Command`

  - String or str in struct
      [ ] &str - cheap runtime
      [ ] String - modification (by default?)
      [x] Cow - both

  - Hold enums instead of commands/flags/etc or strings internally?
      [x] Strings kind (performance pass to std::process::Command, no need to decode)
      [ ] Enums kind (performance analysis, modification, need to decode in strings
      before work with std::process::Command)

  - Binary and control mode commands commons?
      [ ] Separate structs (holding data only needed)
        `TmuxBin`,`TmuxBinCommand`, `TmuxBinCommands` - holding bin name
        `TmuxCommand`, `TmuxCommands` - holding only name, env and args
        (complexity+)
        ```
        TmuxBin {
            env
            bin
            args
        }
        ```
        ```
        TmuxCommand {
            cmd
            args
        }
        ```
        ```
        TmuxBinCommand {
            tmux: TmuxBin
            cmd: TmuxCommand
        }
        ```
      [ ] One struct `TmuxCommand` (holding universal data)
        TmuxCommand, TmuxCommands - holding env, bin, bin args, cmd, cmd args
        (rel.easy, not elegant, control mode needs binary name once but may be stored
        multiple times in vec)
        ```
        TmuxCommand {
            env
            bin
            bin_args
            cmd
            cmd_args
        }
        ```
  - Consuming non consuming builder
      - [x] -> &mut Self (better for chaining s. rust doc)
      - [ ] -> Self ()

  - trait command methods exec
      [x] no, fields inaccessible directly, only methods set get, implementation  imol for needed,
      same thing.
      [ ] yes

 - no need to set Option<bool>

 - args/fns names
      [ ] exact as original
      [x] near the original
      [ ] rename for consistance cwd, target, name (example: `new_session().session_name("")` better
      `new_session().name("")`)

  - consuming not consuming builder pattern?
      [ ] self
      [x] &mut self (preferred) but here?
